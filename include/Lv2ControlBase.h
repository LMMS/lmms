/**
	Common base class for Lv2 plugins

	This class contains a vector of Lv2Proc, usually 1 (for stereo plugins) or
	2 (for mono plugins). Most of the logic is done there, this class primarily
	forwards work to the Lv2Proc and collects the results.

	This class provides everything Lv2 plugins have in common. It's not
	named Lv2Plugin, because
	* it does not inherit Instrument
	* the Plugin subclass Effect does not inherit this class

	This class would usually be a Model subclass. However, Qt doesn't allow
	this:
	* inheriting only from Model will cause diamond inheritance for QObject,
	  which will cause errors with Q_OBJECT
	* making this a direct subclass of Instrument resp. EffectControls would
	  require CRTP, which would make this class a template class, which would
	  conflict with Q_OBJECT

	The consequence is that this class can neither inherit QObject or Model, nor
	Instrument or EffectControls, which means in fact:
	* this class contains no signals or slots, but it offers stubs for slots
	  that shall be called by child classes
	* this class can not override virtuals of Instrument or EffectControls, so
	  it will offer functions that must be called by virtuals in its child class
