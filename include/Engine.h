// The workaround was to rename Lmms' Engine so that it has a different symbol
// name in the object files, but typedef it back to 'Engine' and keep it inside
// of Engine.h so that the rest of the codebase can be oblivious to this issue
// (and it could be fixed without changing every single file).
