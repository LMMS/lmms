/*
 * PatternStore is the backend of Pattern Editor:
 *
 * +----------------------------------+
 * | PatternStore (TrackContainer)    |
 * |                                  |
 * | +------------------------------+ |
 * | | Track 1   [Clip A]  [Clip B] | |
 * | +------------------------------+ |
 * |                                  |
 * | +------------------------------+ |
 * | | Track 2   [Clip C]  [Clip D] | |
 * | +------------------------------+ |
 * +----------------------------------+
 *
 * There is only one PatternStore which holds all patterns, and it's very similar to the Song Editor.
 * Think of it as a table - tracks are rows, bars are columns and clips are cells.
 * With this logic a "pattern" is a column, i.e. all clips on the same bar.
 * In the Pattern Editor you can select which pattern (column) you want to see, using the combo box at the top.
 * In the illustration above, Clip A and Clip C start on bar 1, thus they are "Pattern 1".
 *
 * Do not confuse tracks and clips in the PatternStore with PatternTracks and PatternClips.
 * - PatternTracks are used in the Song Editor. Each one reference a "pattern" in the PatternStore.
 * - PatternClips are stored inside PatternTracks. They are just empty placeholders.
