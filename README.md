What is BLUE-LMMS?
--------------

The BluefinServer version of LMMS

This is my own personal version of lmms with which i will experiment 

This entire Project is made soley for fun and experimentation sake, it is not to discredit anyones work, It is to see what i can do on my own to make the daw better. 

I have absolutely no idea what im doing! Which is why i dont want to actually work on the main project. If any of my brain worms, ideas and merges do work for the project, i urge devs of LMMS to just take it and run with it, if they want.

Experimental Features
---------

* Audio recording implementation


  Im hoping to figure out, how to provide actuall releases so that no one that might be interested will have to go through the hassles that i go through.
