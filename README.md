This repository is a fork of the LMMS effect system for developing a new frequency-domain **Transfer Function** plugin.  
So far, the STFT engine and user interface are implemented, and I am currently working on the transfer-function parser.  
The goal is to allow users to define arbitrary H(ω) curves for creative spectral processing inside LMMS.

Native Plugins must be compiled within LMMS. The aim is to create a cross platform plugin.
