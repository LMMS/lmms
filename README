What is LMMS?
--------------

LMMS is a free cross-platform alternative to commercial programs like FL Studio (R), which allow you to produce music with your computer. This includes the creation of melodies and beats, the synthesis and mixing of sounds, and arranging of samples. You can have fun with your MIDI-keyboard and much more; all in a user-friendly and modern interface.


Features
---------

    * Song-Editor for composing songs
    * A Beat+Bassline-Editor for creating beats and basslines
    * An easy-to-use Piano-Roll for editing patterns and melodies
    * An FX mixer with 64 FX channels and arbitrary number of effects allow unlimited mixing possibilities
    * Many powerful instrument and effect-plugins out of the box
    * Full user-defined track-based automation and computer-controlled automation sources
    * Compatible with many standards such as SoundFont2, VST(i), LADSPA, GUS Patches, and full MIDI support
    * Import of MIDI and FLP (Fruityloops(R) Project) files


Requirements
------------

The most important requirement is for sure a fast computer, so don't try to get
LMMS working on a pentium I with 60 MHz... ;-) Therefore you should have at
least 500 MHz, but for really enjoying LMMS less than 1 GHz makes no sense...


Required libraries:

- Qt >= 4.3.0 with devel-files (4.4.x recommended)

Optional, but strongly recommended:
- JACK with devel-files
- libvorbis & libogg with devel-files
- libalsa with devel-files
- SDL with devel-files
- libsamplerate >= 0.1.7 with devel-files
- libsndfile with devel-files
- WINE + WINE-devel-files
- stk, libstk + libstk-dev
- libfluidsynth with devel files
- fftw3 with devel-files
- libfltk1.3 with devel-files (needed by ZynAddSubFx)

For compiling you should have an up to date GCC with g++.

If you have problems with compiling or running LMMS, find any bug or have
suggestions and so on, please feel free to e-mail me (for mail-address see
below)!



Building
---------
