// Rate counter periods are calculated from the Envelope Rates table in
// the Programmer's Reference Guide. The rate counter period is the number of
// cycles between each increment of the envelope counter.
// The rates have been verified by sampling ENV3. 
//
// The rate counter is a 16 bit register which is incremented each cycle.
// When the counter reaches a specific comparison value, the envelope counter
// is incremented (attack) or decremented (decay/release) and the
// counter is zeroed.
//
// NB! Sampling ENV3 shows that the calculated values are not exact.
// It may seem like most calculated values have been rounded (.5 is rounded
// down) and 1 has beed added to the result. A possible explanation for this
// is that the SID designers have used the calculated values directly
// as rate counter comparison values, not considering a one cycle delay to
// zero the counter. This would yield an actual period of comparison value + 1.
//
// The time of the first envelope count can not be exactly controlled, except
// possibly by resetting the chip. Because of this we cannot do cycle exact
// sampling and must devise another method to calculate the rate counter
// periods.
//
// The exact rate counter periods can be determined e.g. by counting the number
// of cycles from envelope level 1 to envelope level 129, and dividing the
// number of cycles by 128. CIA1 timer A and B in linked mode can perform
// the cycle count. This is the method used to find the rates below.
//
// To avoid the ADSR delay bug, sampling of ENV3 should be done using
// sustain = release = 0. This ensures that the attack state will not lower
// the current rate counter period.
//
// The ENV3 sampling code below yields a maximum timing error of 14 cycles.
//     lda #$01
// l1: cmp $d41c
//     bne l1
//     ...
//     lda #$ff
// l2: cmp $d41c
//     bne l2
//
// This yields a maximum error for the calculated rate period of 14/128 cycles.
// The described method is thus sufficient for exact calculation of the rate
// periods.

// For decay and release, the clock to the envelope counter is sequentially
// divided by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 30, 1 to create a piece-wise linear approximation
// of an exponential. The exponential counter period is loaded at the envelope
// counter values 255, 93, 54, 26, 14, 6, 0. The period can be different for the
// same envelope counter value, depending on whether the envelope has been
// rising (attack -> release) or sinking (decay/release).
//
// Since it is not possible to reset the rate counter (the test bit has no
// influence on the envelope generator whatsoever) a method must be devised to
// do cycle exact sampling of ENV3 to do the investigation. This is possible
// with knowledge of the rate period for A=0, found above.
//
// The CPU can be synchronized with ENV3 by first synchronizing with the rate
// counter by setting A=0 and wait in a carefully timed loop for the envelope
// counter _not_ to change for 9 cycles. We can then wait for a specific value
// of ENV3 with another timed loop to fully synchronize with ENV3.
//
// At the first period when an exponential counter period larger than one
// is used (decay or relase), one extra cycle is spent before the envelope is
// decremented. The envelope output is then delayed one cycle until the state
// is changed to attack. Now one cycle less will be spent before the envelope
// is incremented, and the situation is normalized.
// The delay is probably caused by the comparison with the exponential counter,
// and does not seem to affect the rate counter. This has been verified by
// timing 256 consecutive complete envelopes with A = D = R = 1, S = 0, using
// CIA1 timer A and B in linked mode. If the rate counter is not affected the
// period of each complete envelope is
// (255 + 162*1 + 39*2 + 28*4 + 12*8 + 8*16 + 6*30)*32 = 756*32 = 32352
// which corresponds exactly to the timed value divided by the number of
// complete envelopes.
// NB! This one cycle delay is not modeled.


// From the sustain levels it follows that both the low and high 4 bits of the
// envelope counter are compared to the 4-bit sustain value.
// This has been verified by sampling ENV3.
