	* getport() -- read access to control ports which is clamped to port bounds
		and maps inf and nan to 0 as well
	* all LADSPA_HINT_SAMPLE_RATE ports changed to *_LOGARITHMIC because
		of broken implementations (no surprise given the vagueness of ladspa.h
		regarding this matter) -- this means changed default parameters of the 
		affected ports, too
	* VCO* "latency" output ports removed
	* actual activate() call is deferred to first run() after activate() 
		in order to prevent inadvertent parameter smoothing sweeps during the first 
		block	of audio after activation, this should fix all problems with ardour
		(except those caused by denormals or invalid audio input)

		interpolation of a sample table obtained from spice simulation

		of the lad mailing list community
