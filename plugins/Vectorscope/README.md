# Vectorscope plugin

## Overview

This plugin consists of one widget and back-end code to provide it with required data.

The top-level widget is VecControlDialog. It displays configuration knobs and the VectorView widget. The back-end class for its configuration is VecControls, which holds all configuration values.

VectorView computes and shows the visualization results. Data for processing are received from the Vectorscope class, which handles the interface with LMMS.
