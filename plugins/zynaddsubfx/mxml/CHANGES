	  conforms to an updated XML schema, described in the file
	  "doc/mxmldoc.xsd".
	- Changed the whitespace callback interface to return
	  strings instead of a single character, allowing for

	  written using Mini-XML.  THIS CHANGE WILL REQUIRE
	  CHANGES TO YOUR 1.x CODE IF YOU USE WHITESPACE
	  CALLBACKS.

	- Updated the mxmldoc output to be more compatible with
	  embedding in manuals produced with HTMLDOC.
	- The makefile incorrectly included a "/" separator

	  caused problems when building and installing with
	  MingW.


CHANGES IN Mini-XML 1.3

	- Fixes for mxmldoc.
	- Added support for reading standard HTML entity names.
	- mxmlLoadString/File() did not decode character
	  entities in element names, attribute names, or
	  attribute values.

	  conformant XML data under an existing parent (top)
	  node.
	- Fixed several bugs in the mxmldoc utility.
	- Added new error callback function to catch a variety
	  of errors and log them to someplace other than stderr.
	- The mxmlElementSetAttr() function now allows for NULL
	  attribute values.

	  element and attribute name strings properly, e.g. for
	  !DOCTYPE declarations.

	- Added new "set" methods to set the value of a node.
	- Added new formatted text methods mxmlNewTextf() and
	  mxmlSetTextf() to create/set a text node value using
	  printf-style formats.
	- Added new standard callbacks for use with the mxmlLoad
	  functions.
	- Updated the HTML documentation to include examples of
	  the walk and load function output.
	- Added --with/without-ansi configure option to control
	  the strdup() function check.
	- Added --with/without-snprintf configure option to
	  control the snprintf() and vsnprintf() function
	  checks.


CHANGES IN Mini-XML 1.1.2

	  functions.
	- mxmlSaveString() returned the wrong number of
	  characters.
	- mxml_add_char() updated the buffer pointer in the
	  wrong place.


CHANGES IN Mini-XML 1.1.1

	- The private mxml_add_ch() function did not update the
	  start-of-buffer pointer which could cause a crash when
	  using mxmlSaveString().
	- The private mxml_write_ws() function called putc()
	  instead of using the proper callback which could cause
	  a crash when using mxmlSaveString().
	- Added a mxmlSaveAllocString() convenience function for
	  saving an XML node tree to an allocated string.


CHANGES IN Mini-XML 1.1

	- The mxmlLoadFile() function now uses dynamically
	  allocated string buffers for element names, attribute
	  names, and attribute values.  Previously they were
	  capped at 16383, 255, and 255 bytes, respectively.
	- Added a new mxmlLoadString() function for loading an
	  XML node tree from a string.
	- Added a new mxmlSaveString() function for saving an
	  XML node tree to a string.
	- Add emulation of strdup() if the local platform does
	  not provide the function.


CHANGES IN Mini-XML 1.0

	- The mxmldoc program now handles function arguments,
	  structures, unions, enumerations, classes, and
	  typedefs properly.
	- Documentation provided via mxmldoc and more in-line
	  comments in the code.
	- Added man pages and packaging files.


CHANGES IN Mini-XML 0.93

	- New mxmldoc example program that is also used to
	  create and update code documentation using XML and
	  produce HTML reference pages.
	- Added mxmlAdd() and mxmlRemove() functions to add and
	  remove nodes from a tree.  This provides more
	  flexibility over where the nodes are inserted and
	  allows nodes to be moved within the tree as needed.
	- mxmlLoadFile() now correctly handles comments.
	- mxmlLoadFile() now supports the required "gt", "quot",
	  and "nbsp" character entities.
	- mxmlSaveFile() now uses newlines as whitespace
	  when valid to do so.
	- mxmlFindElement() now also takes attribute name and
	  attribute value string arguments to limit the search
	  to specific elements with attributes and/or values.
	  NULL pointers can be used as "wildcards".
	- Added uninstall target to makefile, and auto-reconfig
	  if Makefile.in or configure.in are changed.
	- mxmlFindElement(), mxmlWalkNext(), and mxmlWalkPrev()
	  now all provide "descend" arguments to control whether
	  they descend into child nodes in the tree.
	- Fixed some whitespace issues in mxmlLoadFile().
	- Fixed Unicode output and whitespace issues in
	  mxmlSaveFile().
	- mxmlSaveFile() now supports a whitespace callback to
	  provide more human-readable XML output under program
	  control.


CHANGES IN Mini-XML 0.92

	- mxmlSaveFile() didn't return a value on success.


CHANGES IN Mini-XML 0.91

	- mxmlWalkNext() would go into an infinite loop.


CHANGES IN Mini-XML 0.9

	- Initial public release.
