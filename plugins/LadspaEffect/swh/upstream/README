Compiling
~~~~~~~~~
You will need libfftw version 2 or 3 installed with 32 bit float support (eg.
for FFTW3 use --enable-float), for FFTW recommend you specify the appropriate
SIMD instruction set for your CPU with --enable-sse, --enable-sse2, --enable-k7
or --enable-altivec. You can get FFTW from http://www.fftw.org/.

Install with
   autoreconf -i
   ./configure
   make
   su -c "make install".

This code is normally built from XML source, using Perl and XML::Parser. I
distribute the generated .c files, so you wont need perl, but if you want to
edit the XML source then you will need a copy of Perl and XML::Parser
installed.
