TAP-plugins (Tom's Audio Processing plugins)

Welcome!

TAP-plugins is a bunch of LADSPA plugins for audio processing. It runs
on the GNU/Linux operating system, and possibly other UNIX-like
operating systems.

LADSPA stands for Linux Audio Developers Simple Plugin API.
Learn more about LADSPA at http://www.ladspa.org

You need a LADSPA-aware host program to use these plugins.
I recommend using Ardour, which is a professional multichannel hard
disc recorder and digital audio workstation for Linux.  These plugins
were developed and tested using Ardour, but they should work with any
LADSPA-capable host.  Learn more about Ardour at http://ardour.org



Installation and usage of the plugins is very simple.  Please take a
moment to edit the top of the Makefile if you wish to install the
plugins in a directory other than /usr/local/lib/ladspa (the default
place for plugins).  A destination directory for RDF metadata is also
set there (defaults to /usr/local/share/ladspa/rdf) which you may also
want to change. Then run "make" and (as root) "make install".  No
special packages are needed to compile these plugins, so there is no
./configure script.

A thorough manual is provided in html format. It is identical to the
project website. There is no need to save that manually, though: it is
provided as a separate package called tap-plugins-doc. After
downloading and untarring it, just open index.html with your favorite
Any Browser to view it.

Questions, comments, suggestions, bugreports and fixes are always
welcome at: <tszilagyi@users.sourceforge.net>


Have fun, turn up the volume and kick the shit out of your neighbours!
