# A wrapper around pkg-config-provided and cmake-provided bash completion that
# will have dynamic behavior at INSTALL() time to allow both root-level
# INSTALL() as well as user-level INSTALL().

# Usage:
#    INCLUDE(BashCompletion)
#    BASHCOMP_INSTALL(foo)
#    ... where "foo" is a shell script adjacent to the CMakeLists.txt
#
# How it determines BASHCOMP_PKG_PATH, in order:
#    1. Uses BASHCOMP_PKG_PATH if already set (e.g. -DBASHCOMP_PKG_PATH=...)
#       a. If not, uses pkg-config's PKG_CHECK_MODULES to determine path
#       b. Fallback to cmake's FIND_PACKAGE(bash-completion) path
#       c. Fallback to hard-coded /usr/share/bash-completion/completions
#    2. Final fallback to ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/bash-completion/completions if
#       detected path is unwritable.

# - Windows does not support bash completion
# - macOS support should eventually be added for Homebrew (TODO)
