# AppRun Hooks

Scripts placed in this directory will automatically be bundled into linuxdeploy AppImages
(e.g. `LMMS.AppDir/apprun-hooks`) and executed immediately before lmms.

> "Sometimes it's important to perform actions before running the actual app.  Some plugins might have to set e.g., 
> environment variables to work properly."
